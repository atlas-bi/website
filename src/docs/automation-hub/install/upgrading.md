# Upgrading


## Recommended Method

### Create A Backup

Before updating it is recommended to take a backup. The backup files are stored in `/etc/atlas-hub/backups`. They will include a database dump, the current configuration, the current connection passwords, and the current install of the app.

```bash
atlas-hub --backup
```

If you've installed Atlas Hub using the recommended installer you can easily update with

```bash
atlas-hub --upgrade
```

Or, use the standard commands

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install atlas-hub
```
